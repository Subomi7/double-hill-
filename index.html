        <h1>Who are we</h1>
        <p>In short, Kefi is “the spirit of joy”, which is no coincidence to our name. Although we’re aware that everyone has their own unique meanings of joy, we also know that it always comes down to freedom. Our core mission is to help create that freedom, thus helping you “find your Kefi”. For our investment partners, we aim to transcend all expectations in each and every transaction during the course of your investment. We strive to free your time by dealing with the nitty gritty ins and outs of managing and maintaining the real estate, while at the same time increasing your wealth and creating passive income for you. For our tenants, we look to give them the freedom of expression by creating a community-based environment. We are thrilled knowing our tenants can feel a support system both from us and from one another to be able to be who they are, and express themselves authentically.</p>
